# Contributing to Gradio UI
You can start by forking or cloning the repo (https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio-UI.git) and creating your own branch to work from. All PRs must pass the continuous integration 
tests and receive approval from a member of the Gradio UI development team before they will be merged.

### Continuous Integration and Testing
All PRs must pass the continuous integration tests before merging. To test locally, you can run `python3 -m unittest`.


### Submitting PRs

All PRs should be against `master`. Direct commits to master are blocked, and PRs require an approving review
to merge into master. By convention, the Gradio UI maintainers will review PRs when:
  * An initial review has been requested
  * A maintainer is tagged in the PR comments and asked to complete a review

We ask that you make sure initial CI checks are passing before requesting a review.
One of the Gradio UI maintainers will merge the PR when all the checks are passing.
